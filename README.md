# Gegensprechanlage
*Minimum viable [prototype](./prototyp)*

My wife keeps calling me from a different room, I keep not hearing. And it's oh so far.
Time to solve that problem with technology.

The plan: place some raspis with a speaker and microphone in strategic locations, record a message when their button is pressed, auto-play it on all other raspis in the house.

The status: A raspi and a button exist, but I don't have a microphone or suitable spearkers. So for now, this reads morse code from GPIO and sends it to matrix.
